See the derived fields PROCODE3 and PROCODET for alternative ways to identify the provider organisation.

Note that the structure of newly allocated organisation codes changed in 2020:

For organisation codes that were allocated prior to October 2020:
Organisations are allocated a main 3-character code which represents the organisation (e.g. an NHS Trust), and 5-character codes to represent sites within that organisation. Sites are allocated the same first 3 characters as the organisation code, with the remaining 2 characters being used to identify the site within that organisation.  For NHS organisations, this field may contain the 3-character organisation code or a full 5-character code (e.g. a site code, a HQ code ending 01 etc.), depending on what was submitted by the provider. Independent providers will always be represented in this field by a 5-character code.

Organisation codes that begin with an '8' represent non-NHS organisations and do not follow the same format - these codes are 5 characters long and cannot be grouped based on the first 3 characters of the code.

For organisation codes allocated from 1st October 2020 onwards:
Organisation codes are 5 characters in length, with an alternating ANANA alphabetic-numeric structure (where ‘A’ represents an alphabetic character, and ‘N’ represents a numeric character). Unlike the previous code structure, these codes cannot be grouped to the first 3-characters to identify the parent organisation code.

The new code structure introduced in 1 October 2020 has only been applied to codes that were registered from this date onwards (codes issued prior to this date will not be replaced with a new format code). A mixture of the different code formats will therefore be present in the data from 2020-21 onwards.","3an or 5an = Organisation identifier
