This directory contains sample data files that are used for the automatic tests.

The data files are sourced from the NHS Digital [Artificial data pilot](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/artificial-data)Â and are used under their [open data policies](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/supporting-open-data-and-transparency).

There is some code that may be used to generate sample data in the R script `R/get_sample_data.R`.
