[dataverifyr](https://davzim.github.io/dataverifyr/) is a data validation package for R.

The files in this directory are used to define sets of rules to be applied to check that data are valid.

See: [Read and write rules to a yaml file](https://davzim.github.io/dataverifyr/reference/write_rules.html)

```R
dataverifyr::read_rules(file)
```
